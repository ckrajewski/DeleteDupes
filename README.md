Delete Dupes
===========
Delete Dupes v 1.0

 A simple Python script that groups suspected duplicate files and moves them into a file for you to review before you permanently delete them.
 Files are deemed suspected duplicates with they generate the same MD5 checksum.
 
-Deletes dupes in a single file only
-Must edit Python file to modify the directory that DeleteDupes.py should scan and where it should put the suspected duplicate files

Upcoming Enhancements:

-Will populate the pathname for the directory that Delete Dups should scan from a text file.
-Will look into using os.walk to crawl through sub directories as well.
